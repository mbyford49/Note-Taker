Note Taker is a simple, easy to use app that'll keep you organized! Give your note a title and fill in the text of your note and save it. Once saved your note will be added to the note section on the left side of the page.
To review your note, click the tile and to open it back up. If you no longer need a note simply click the trash can to delete it.

If you would like this app for yourself, clone the code from this repo to create your own. Once you have created your own repo, in the command line do an npm install to install dependencies, then npm start to run locally
on your machine.

Here is a link to see what a deployed version of this app looks like.
